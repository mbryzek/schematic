# Circuit Schematic Builder - Development Status

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETE)

### What's Working
- **Project Structure**: Complete directory layout with organized CSS and JS modules
- **HTML Template**: Responsive single-page application with toolbar, canvas, and component panel
- **Theme System**: Light/dark mode toggle with CSS custom properties and localStorage persistence
- **Canvas System**:
  - SVG-based grid canvas with zoom (mouse wheel) and pan (shift+drag)
  - Grid pattern with toggle visibility
  - Coordinate transformation utilities (screen ↔ world ↔ grid)
  - Zoom levels from 25% to 400%
- **Storage System**: localStorage wrapper for preferences, schematics, and user components
- **Component Panel UI**: Search box, category filters, and scrollable component list

### Files Created
- `index.html` - Main application page
- `css/theme.css` - Theme variables and dark mode
- `css/main.css` - Layout and toolbar styles
- `css/components.css` - Component panel styles
- `css/canvas.css` - Canvas and SVG styles
- `js/app.js` - Main application controller
- `js/storage.js` - localStorage management
- `js/theme.js` - Theme switching
- `js/canvas.js` - Canvas zoom/pan/grid system
- `js/component-manager.js` - Component loading (partial)
- `js/drag-drop.js` - Drag and drop (skeleton)
- `js/wire-router.js` - Wire routing (skeleton)
- `js/export.js` - PNG export (skeleton)
- `README.md` - User documentation

### Example Components Created
- `components/resistor.json` - Resistor symbol
- `components/capacitor.json` - Capacitor symbol
- `components/inductor.json` - Inductor/coil symbol
- `components/diode.json` - Standard diode
- `components/led.json` - LED with arrows
- `components/ground.json` - Ground symbol
- `components/vcc.json` - Power supply symbol

## ✅ Phase 2: Component System (COMPLETE)

### What's Working

1. **✅ Load Components from JSON Files**
   - Components now load asynchronously from `/components` directory
   - 11 built-in components included (resistor, capacitor, inductor, diode, LED, transistor, op-amp, switch, battery, ground, VCC)
   - Error handling for failed loads
   - Loading spinner while fetching

2. **✅ Render Components in Panel**
   - Components display with SVG icons
   - Proper error handling for invalid SVG
   - Visual categorization by type

3. **✅ Search and Filter**
   - Real-time search through component names and categories
   - Category buttons filter by type (passive, active, power, user)
   - Empty state message when no components match

4. **✅ Component Upload**
   - File picker for JSON uploads
   - Validation of component structure
   - Duplicate detection with replace option
   - Components saved to localStorage
   - Clear input after upload for reusability

## 🚧 Phase 3: Drag & Drop (NEXT - IN PROGRESS)

### Requirements
- Drag components from panel to canvas
- Show ghost/preview during drag
- Snap to grid on drop
- Create component instances on canvas
- Make components draggable on canvas
- Component selection (click to select)
- Delete selected components (Del key)

### Key Files to Implement
- `js/drag-drop.js` - Complete drag and drop logic
- Need new module: `js/schematic-manager.js` - Manage component instances and wires

## 📋 Phase 4: Wire Routing (PLANNED)

### Requirements
- Click endpoint to start wire
- Manual waypoint placement (click to add points)
- Auto-routing between endpoints (A* algorithm)
- 45° wire mode (Shift key)
- Wire preview while drawing
- Junction dots where wires meet
- Wire selection and deletion

### Key Files to Implement
- `js/wire-router.js` - Complete wire routing algorithms

## 📋 Phase 5: User Components (PLANNED)

### Requirements
- File upload button working
- JSON validation
- Save to localStorage
- Display in "User" category
- Export user components

### Status
- Basic structure is in place in `component-manager.js`
- Need testing and refinement

## 📋 Phase 6: PNG Export (PLANNED)

### Requirements
- Calculate content bounds
- Render SVG to canvas
- Theme-aware background
- High-resolution export
- Download with proper filename

### Status
- Basic structure in `js/export.js`
- Needs testing once components are on canvas

## 📋 Phase 7: Polish & UX (PLANNED)

### Requirements
- Keyboard shortcuts (R=rotate, F=flip, etc.)
- Undo/redo history
- Component labels (double-click to edit)
- Save/load schematics
- Responsive design for mobile
- Error handling and validation

## Testing Checklist

### Phase 1 ✅
- [x] Page loads without errors
- [x] Theme toggle works
- [x] Zoom in/out with buttons and mouse wheel
- [x] Pan with shift+drag
- [x] Grid visibility toggle
- [x] Status bar shows cursor position
- [x] localStorage saves preferences

### Phase 2 ✅
- [x] Components load from JSON files
- [x] Components display in panel with proper icons
- [x] Search filters components
- [x] Category buttons filter components
- [x] Upload button opens file picker
- [x] Component validation on upload
- [x] User components saved to localStorage

### Phase 3 📋
- [ ] Can drag components from panel
- [ ] Ghost appears during drag
- [ ] Component snaps to grid on drop
- [ ] Component appears on canvas
- [ ] Can select components
- [ ] Can drag components on canvas
- [ ] Delete key removes selected components

### Phase 4 📋

## Known Issues

1. **Component Loading**: Currently hardcoded, needs to load from JSON files
2. **SVG Viewbox**: Component SVG might need viewBox adjustments for proper scaling
3. **Browser Testing**: Only tested in Chrome/Safari, need Firefox testing
4. **Mobile**: Not yet optimized for touch devices

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Fix component loading to read from JSON files
2. Test and debug component rendering
3. Verify search and filter functionality
4. Move to Phase 3: Drag & Drop implementation

## Performance Targets

- [x] Page load < 2 seconds
- [x] Smooth 60fps zoom/pan
- [ ] Support 100+ components on canvas
- [ ] PNG export < 3 seconds

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- 🚧 Firefox 88+ (needs testing)
- 🚧 Edge 90+ (needs testing)
- ❌ Mobile browsers (Phase 7)
